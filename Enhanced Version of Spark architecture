Legend/Explanation
Driver Program: Runs on your local/client machine and encapsulates:
SparkContext (sc): The main context object connecting to the cluster (Master). All jobs, RDD, and DataFrame operations go through it.
DAGScheduler/TaskScheduler: Internal logical and physical planning and scheduling components managed by SparkContext.
DAGScheduler: Converts your job’s logical execution plan into stages.
TaskScheduler: Schedules and sends tasks for each stage to executors.
Master: Receives driver’s requests, allocates cluster resources, and supervises worker nodes.
Worker Nodes: Run in the cluster, monitored by the Master. Host one or more executor JVMs per application.
Executor JVM(s): Execute tasks, manage task-level memory/cache (BlockManager), and facilitate shuffle (data exchange).
BlockManager: Handles all storage for caches, shuffle data, spills, etc., distributed across executors and workers.
Shuffle Service: Handles the network exchange of data between tasks/executors on different nodes during shuffle-intensive operations like groupBy, reduceByKey, join.
Tasks: The smallest unit of execution, assigned to executor threads by TaskScheduler, working on partitions of the input data.
Distributed Storage: The persistent storage systems Spark reads from and writes to (HDFS, S3, Azure Blob, local disk, RDBMS, Hive, NoSQL DBs, etc.).
Web UI: Accessible from both master and workers for tracking jobs, storage usage, executor stats, stages/tasks, and metrics.
Communication/Shuffle: Dashed lines represent task and shuffle data exchanges (critical for wide transformations).
Heartbeats/Monitoring: Workers/executors send regular heartbeats to the master for liveness detection.
Key Points
SparkContext is the main entry for the Driver and controls everything.
All coordination of jobs, resources, data, and results flows through these components.
Actual computation & storage are on Executors within Worker nodes.
Effective use of partitioning, caching (BlockManager), and shuffle service ensures scalable and fast analytics.
